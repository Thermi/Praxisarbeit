\section{High Availability}


High Availability is usually implemented by duplicating the service over several distinct physical or
virtual hosts. The hosts are called a \"cluster\". The software on the hosts and other resources
that are duplicated and necessary for the service are managed by what is called a \"cluster manager\".
Said manager handles cluster communication and failover action over several hosts if a local service,
that is protected by \ac{HA} goes down.

\section{Cluster Types}

Naturally, there exist different types of clusters for different purposes.
\begin{itemize}
\item High Availability Cluster to increase the availability of services.
\item High Performance Clusters to increase the performance of services.
\item Load Balancing Cluster to balance the load of a service.
\end{itemize}

In this work, we will only look at High Availability Clusters.
High Availability Clusters are usually used for critical infrastructure,
which must be available most of the time. Examples for such a case are DNS servers,
routers and firewalls, as well as \ac{ERP} systems.

\subsection{\ac{HA} clustering on Linux}

\ac{HA} clustering on Linux started in the 1998  with Alan Robertson's ''Linux HA'' project,
which spawned the ''Heartbeat'' protocol and a cluster stack capable of handling two nodes.
Alan Robertson was hired by the S.u.S.E. Linux Gmbh in the year 2000.
A group frm the University of Minnesota, later known as ''Sistina Software'', which worked
on a clustered file system, which was later known as ''Global File System''.
