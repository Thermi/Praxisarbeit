\section{Software}
To implement High Availability, different types of software for different purposes are used.
As mentioned before, a cluster manager is used for communication between the different hosts that
provide services in the cluster. Services are commonly called "resources" in the cluster world.
Another software is the resource manager, which manages the resources themselves.
This includes starting, stopping and monitoring the resources.
