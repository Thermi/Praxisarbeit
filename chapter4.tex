\section{Setting up a HA cluster on Linux}
This part is about the real wordl installation of an \ac{HA} cluster on Linux using the tools introduced in the former sections.

\subsection{Cluster architecture}
For the cluster, we will use 3 CentOS 7 \acp{VM}, which are connected
to three \acp{VLAN}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 192.168.178.0/24 for public cluster resources
\item 192.168.180.0/24 for the management of the clusters
\item 192.168.181.64/27 for the cluster communication
\end{itemize}
The services we are going to set up are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A cluster IP
\item A lighttpd web server to host an example web site
\item A shared storage built with DRBD and GS2
\end{itemize}

Fencing will be implemented using fence-virt over a serial device
on the guests.
