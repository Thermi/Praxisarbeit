\section{Introduction}

High availability is an important aspect of network services in the corporate
sectore, as it decreases the time a service is unavailable to users.
Such services might be business critical, like ERP\footnote{Enterprise Resource Planning} systems.
Therefore it is necessary to evaluate and implement high availability in those systems.

High Availability is usually implemented by duplicating the service over several distinct physical or
virtual hosts. The hosts are called a \"cluster\". The software on the hosts and other resources
that are duplicated and necessary for the service are managed by what is called a \"cluster manager\".
