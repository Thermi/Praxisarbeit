The hosts in the cluster usually provide a service for which persistent shared data storage is necessary.
If those files are static or are rarely modified, locally storing them on each node can be a solution. However, caution is advised, as makeshifts have a bad habit of sticking around.
There are two different feasible ways to implement this in a cluster environment:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using a storage area network
\item Using a network access storage
\end{itemize}

Using a storage area network in a cluster environment is good choice as it provides highly available access, if the SAN\footnote{storage area network} is layed out for high availability. That is the case in enterprise environments. As such, it can be relied upon.
Using network access storage is a more common solution for providing access to data in an environment where concurrent access is needed, but cluster file systems are not an option. In such a case, the cluster members would access the data over network protocols like NFS\footnote{Network File System} or CIFS\footnote{Common Internet File System}. For concurrent access to shared storagein a cluster, file systems like GFS\footnote{Gluster File System}, OCFS2\footnote{Oracle Cluster File System 2} or CephFS have to be used, as those provide a lock manager, which is needed for data integrity. In the following sections, we will go over some cluster file systems and shared storage providers, as well as Ceph in an extra section.

Ceph has a special position in the cluster world, as it provides all aspects of shared storage:
\begin{itemize}
\item block devices
\item cluster file systems
\item object storage
\end{itemize}

Ceph is an open source cluster storage platform to provide block, file and object storage to other hosts. It is constructed in a manner that prevents SPoFs\footnote{Single Point Of Failure}, scales well to exabyte levels and provides redundancy to prevent data loss. It is capable of distributing the data across the cluster members and aintaining performance. Ceph supports a virtually unlimited number of cluster members.

Ceph can be used as shared storage provider, over which an arbitrary cluster file system can be layed, but also completely with CephFS as complete shared storage solution. Furthermore, it can be used as storage backend for libvirt and qemu to store virtual machines in. It also provides a gateway for object storage over a REST API and is compliant with the APIs provided by Amazon S3 and Swift.% TODO: Cite!

Users authenticate themselves to the cluster using a mechanism that utilises shared keys and provides authenticity to prevent MITM\footnote{Man In The Middle} attacks. However, no secrecy or replay protection is provided\cite{ceph_architecture}.

Ceph is capable of distributing copies of stored objects over the cluster, as well as striping and dynamically moving the objects to balance the load on the different hosts in the storage cluster. A such, it is a perfect solution for large storage clusters.
